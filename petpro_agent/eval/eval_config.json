  "note": "final_response_match_v2 threshold set to 0.5 to accommodate: 1) Calculated dates (YYYY-MM-DD format) being semantically equivalent to relative date phrases (e.g., 'next weekend', 'Saturday'), but actual responses with calculated dates in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., '2025-12-06' or '2025-12-06 to 2025-12-07') are CORRECT and should be accepted. The evaluator should consider calculated dates as semantically equivalent to relative date phrases. tool_trajectory_avg_score is configured with IN_ORDER match_type to verify tool calls are made in the correct sequence."
